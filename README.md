## What is "Push Pull Legs"?

Push Pull Legs (PPL) is the most common and arguably most efficient workout split that divides workouts by their primary movement.

#### Push:

- Shoulders
- Chest
- Triceps

#### Pull:

- Back
- Biceps

#### Legs:

- Glutes
- Quads
- Hamstrings

#### Target Demographics:

- Weightlifters
- gym-goers
- fitness-enthusiasts.

## Why PPL App?

I love sharing my passion for bodybuilding with friends and family, and I'm often asked to design someone a workout.

The truth is, the most important part of designing a workout plan is ensuring each exercise has a purpose - and the PPL split addresses this perfectly.

Each exercise should target the muscle group in a different way than the previous, and each workout should stimulate the various parts of that muscle group.

**_And here's the other thing..._**

People get bored doing the same workout over and over.

That's why randomizing the workouts was an important feature. The user can add, remove, switch, and randomize until they find a workout they want to do - because what really matters is that they workout period.

### Features:

2. User can search exercises by tag, ie “Glutes”.

3. User can randomly generate a new exercise by double-clicking/tapping current exercise.

4. User can add an exercise by clicking a "plus" icon.

5. User can to expand each exercise to show a description of the movement.

6. User can remove an exercise by clicking a "minus" icon.

7. User can click a "check-mark" icon to mark an exercise complete.

8. User can view completed workout in a separete tab.

## Stretch Features

1. **User can click on a saved workout to redo that workout:**

   It's not uncommon to find a great workout that you want to do again and again. By adding a log in to keep track of the user, they could find their completed workouts and do them as many times as they'd like.

2. **User can view videos of exercise demonstrations:**

   There are limitations when using a public API. The API I've used for PPL App has a limited amount of photos for each exercise, and no videos of the exercise being performed.

   The simplest way to add video demonstrations would be embedding a YouTube link that queries the exercise by name.
